This is an IRC logging bot, and a CGI web interface for showing the logs.

The documentation can be found at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot

For installation please run ./install

When upgrading from older versions of ilbot, please read UPGRADE.pod.

Backends:
    The ./install script only support mysql as database backend,
    but the rest of the code also supports PostgreSQL. There is no working
    migration between mysql and postgresql ilbot databases.
